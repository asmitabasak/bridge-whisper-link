# Bridge Whisper Link 🌉📡

Bridge Whisper Link is an IoT-based structural health monitoring project designed to **collect, transmit, and analyze real-time data from bridges**.  
The system helps in early detection of structural issues by “listening” to the bridge through sensors and sending meaningful insights to a digital dashboard.

This project focuses on **safety, preventive maintenance, and smart infrastructure** using IoT technology.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The main goal of Bridge Whisper Link is to:
- Monitor bridge health in real time
- Detect abnormal vibrations, stress, or environmental changes
- Provide early warnings to prevent accidents
- Support data-driven infrastructure maintenance

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Sensors installed on the bridge collect physical data (vibration, tilt, load, etc.)
2. A microcontroller processes the sensor data
3. Data is transmitted to the cloud using IoT protocols
4. Users can view and analyze data through a dashboard
5. Alerts are triggered if values exceed safe limits
